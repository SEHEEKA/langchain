Animal abuse is prevalent in both urban and rural regions, according to media sources, and cruelty and neglect know no social or economic bounds.

Animal abuse with the intent to harm is closely related to other crimes, especially violence against people. Animals are often the victims of hoarding behavior. Animals may suffer grave neglect if hoarding disorder sufferers house more than they can reasonably care for. Serious animal neglect such as hoarding is frequently a sign that a person needs support for their mental or social well-being. According to surveys, men under 30 are more likely to purposefully harm animals, while women above 60 to hoard animals.

The Indian Constitution makes the protection and well-being of animals a fundamental obligation. The rules not only forbid endangering animals, but they also punish offenders. The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act has been put into effect by the government. It is an enactment to stop the needless suffering or agony of animals and, for that reason, to change the legislation prohibiting animal cruelty that applies to the entire country, with the exception of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Additionally, the government has created the Wildlife Protection Act, an all-encompassing law designed to safeguard endangered wild animals, plants, and birds as well as create ecologically significant protected areas. Additionally, the government has undertaken a number of other programs to protect and conserve animals.

Animal cruelty has long occurred in our society, but it must now be eradicated. To ensure that the laws that already exist are enforced, we must work to strengthen them and teach law enforcement to prosecutors. To alter the public’s viewpoint and sensibilities on animal cruelty, we must educate them. We must take up the role of animal activists. Animal maltreatment must be reported by the public because animals are unable to speak for themselves. Law enforcement, prosecutors, and our courts must work together to bring these offenders to justice and severely punish them.
Wildlife Laws
Legislation has been created specifically to protect rare and endangered species. For instance, Article 15A(G) of the Constitution sought to safeguard and enhance the environment. A similar law is the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. But the oddity is that none of these legislations are being implemented to their full potential. The Wildlife Protection Act, for instance, was updated in 1991, yet it was unable to halt India’s trade in exotic birds. Clearly, laws cannot protect species from extinction on their own. It won’t happen unless we come to value and respect both animal and human life kinds.
Global scenario
A circus animal spends 96% of its life in a cage. Every day, 150 million land animals are murdered for food. Approximately 11,417 sharks are killed by unsustainable finning every hour. Every year, 10 million wild animals are captured and slaughtered just for their fur. Every year, 50 million additional species, including foxes, seals, mink, and raccoon dogs, are murdered for their pelts as well as 1 billion rabbits that have been grown on fur farms or captured in the wild. In laboratories, 15 million warm-blooded animals are tormented every day. Fishing trolleys have wounded 100 million sharks, fish, and aquatic wildlife. Every year, 65 billion animals are murdered for food. Every year, there are nine living humans for every animal.
Global Laws
United Kingdom: Animal carelessness and abuse both carry harsher penalties under UK law governing animal welfare. Pet ownership is prohibited for life, there is a 51-week maximum prison sentence, and there are fines up to £20,000.
Germany: The German Constitution states that “in the sake of future generations, the state has responsibility for conserving the natural foundations of life and creatures.” Thus, Germany became the first nation in the European Union to provide constitutional protection for animals.
