The world we live in is wonderfully beautiful. In this place, all living creatures are interdependent and coexist. It is believed that humans are the most intelligent creatures on Earth. But occasionally, especially when it comes to animals, we become incredibly hypersensitive to the nonverbal animals. We hurt them to meet our needs.
Animal cruelty is the deliberate mistreatment of animals with violence and malice. In many nations, it is unlawful and incredibly inhumane to treat animals inhumanely. Animals are also living creatures that ought to have humane living conditions and be shielded from brutal treatment. Regardless of whether they are domesticated or not, animals cannot be mistreated.

Animal cruelty is now a major concern on a global scale for animal welfare. Due to several human needs, animals endure cruel treatment. This is a major problem that needs to be dealt with and resolved. Numerous people have died as a result of cruelty to animals, and it is steadily getting worse as the world’s population grows.

In many nations and organizations, animal abuse is committed under the guise of research and experimental investigations. Additionally, it has been shown that animals confined in zoos and sanctuaries are not receiving the required care. These are some examples of the brutal treatment that animals endure.
It’s possible that humans are also cruel to animals when they use animals for their amusement. It’s true that some animals enjoy performing; for example, dogs enjoy agility training, and horses enjoy running in a herd, but it becomes a whole different situation when we force them to perform as per our requirements.
There should never be a situation where wild animals are performing for the general population. They wouldn’t choose to do this, yet many of them were trained to do so. A wild animal’s life on the road is terrible even when there is no visible abuse. Cruel treatment includes keeping animals in cages, transporting them over great distances, forcing them into an arena where people are screaming and shouting, keeping them alone frequently without the company of their kind, and preventing them from acting in ways that are consistent with their natural behaviors.

Additionally, there is cruelty in sports, such as whipping a horse to make it run faster or training greyhounds by exposing them to live prey. When animals get old or lose their shape, they may be left behind or put to death. Or they might keep getting sold in a cycle of neglect.

Some other types are as follows:

Experiments: Another kind of animal cruelty is performing experiments on them. 60,000 chemicals are used in cosmetics, and many of them are tested on animals. Chemicals that are corrosive to the eyes are administered in order to assess corneal inflammation. Animals are placed on hot plates while frozen in ice to assess tissue damage. More than 100 million animals, including dogs, rodents, rats, cats, monkeys, rabbits, chickens, and others, are used in scientific testing for drugs, minerals, food, and cosmetics.
Genetic Engineering: Animal productivity is increased, and their development is accelerated, by genetic engineering. Biotechnology has the ability to modify animals. Animal welfare has been adversely impacted by the sharp rise in this over the past few years.
Bullfighting: It is considered by supporters of animal rights to be a cruel blood sport with little place in the contemporary world of peace. Bulls go through a harsh, torturous, and stressful death as a result of this tragedy.
Military animals: Humans utilize military animals including horses, dogs, and whales in conflict. In particular, they are an extension of working animals. Only recently has the use of animals in battle been questioned. Animal abuse charges may now be leveled against practices like using explosives on animals to use them in combat or for military research.
Dogs, cats, horses, and farm animals are the species that are identified as being the subjects of animal cruelty the most. Thousands of farm animals suffer on factory farms, but there isn’t much that can be done legally to lessen their suffering because they sometimes fall outside of the purview of cruelty laws or enjoy much fewer safeguards than pets.

Animal abuse is prevalent in both urban and rural regions, according to media sources, and cruelty and neglect know no social or economic bounds.

Animal abuse with the intent to harm is closely related to other crimes, especially violence against people. Animals are often the victims of hoarding behavior. Animals may suffer grave neglect if hoarding disorder sufferers house more than they can reasonably care for. Serious animal neglect such as hoarding is frequently a sign that a person needs support for their mental or social well-being. According to surveys, men under 30 are more likely to purposefully harm animals, while women above 60 to hoard animals.

The Indian Constitution makes the protection and well-being of animals a fundamental obligation. The rules not only forbid endangering animals, but they also punish offenders. The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act has been put into effect by the government. It is an enactment to stop the needless suffering or agony of animals and, for that reason, to change the legislation prohibiting animal cruelty that applies to the entire country, with the exception of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Additionally, the government has created the Wildlife Protection Act, an all-encompassing law designed to safeguard endangered wild animals, plants, and birds as well as create ecologically significant protected areas. Additionally, the government has undertaken a number of other programs to protect and conserve animals.

Animal cruelty has long occurred in our society, but it must now be eradicated. To ensure that the laws that already exist are enforced, we must work to strengthen them and teach law enforcement to prosecutors. To alter the public’s viewpoint and sensibilities on animal cruelty, we must educate them. We must take up the role of animal activists. Animal maltreatment must be reported by the public because animals are unable to speak for themselves. Law enforcement, prosecutors, and our courts must work together to bring these offenders to justice and severely punish them.
Wildlife Laws
Legislation has been created specifically to protect rare and endangered species. For instance, Article 15A(G) of the Constitution sought to safeguard and enhance the environment. A similar law is the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. But the oddity is that none of these legislations are being implemented to their full potential. The Wildlife Protection Act, for instance, was updated in 1991, yet it was unable to halt India’s trade in exotic birds. Clearly, laws cannot protect species from extinction on their own. It won’t happen unless we come to value and respect both animal and human life kinds.
Global scenario
A circus animal spends 96% of its life in a cage. Every day, 150 million land animals are murdered for food. Approximately 11,417 sharks are killed by unsustainable finning every hour. Every year, 10 million wild animals are captured and slaughtered just for their fur. Every year, 50 million additional species, including foxes, seals, mink, and raccoon dogs, are murdered for their pelts as well as 1 billion rabbits that have been grown on fur farms or captured in the wild. In laboratories, 15 million warm-blooded animals are tormented every day. Fishing trolleys have wounded 100 million sharks, fish, and aquatic wildlife. Every year, 65 billion animals are murdered for food. Every year, there are nine living humans for every animal.
Global Laws
United Kingdom: Animal carelessness and abuse both carry harsher penalties under UK law governing animal welfare. Pet ownership is prohibited for life, there is a 51-week maximum prison sentence, and there are fines up to £20,000.
Germany: The German Constitution states that “in the sake of future generations, the state has responsibility for conserving the natural foundations of life and creatures.” Thus, Germany became the first nation in the European Union to provide constitutional protection for animals.
Organizations working for Animal Rights
PETA: Based in Norfolk, Virginia, PETA is the biggest animal advocacy group in the world, with over 6.5 million supporters and members.  The pain that animals endure in laboratories, the food business, the apparel sector, and the entertainment industry are the main areas on which PETA concentrates. They also spend time discussing other topics, such as the brutal killing and handling of rats, birds, and domesticated animals. Through cruelty investigations, research, animal rescue, legislation, special events, and celebrity involvement, PETA aims to educate the public.
